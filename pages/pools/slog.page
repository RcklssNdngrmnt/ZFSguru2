<h1>Separate log devices</h1>

<p>
 ZFS allows you to utilize <acronym title="Solid State Drive">SSD</acronym>s 
 as separate log device, accelerating so called synchronous write performance. 
 <span class="grey">[<a href="?slog&explain">more information</a>]</span>
</p>

<p class="slog_moreinfo %%CLASS_MOREINFO%%">
 <b>What is a log device?</b><br />
 To protect against misordered writes in case of unclean shutdown, ZFS employs
 an intent log called the <acronym title="ZFS Intent Log">ZIL</acronym>
 that keeps a log of synchronous writes. This feature helps to ensure the 
 application data does not become corrupt due to misordered writes.
 Normally your pool members contains the ZIL. So when using a RAID-Z2 pool, 
 the ZIL is spread across all drives and gains protection from the RAID-Z2 as 
 well. However, harddrives can be slowed down by random writes between their
 regular workloads. 
 Thus, adding a separate log device that basically 'outsources' the ZIL,
 can have a high impact on performance depending on your workload.
 <br /><br /><br />
 <b>When do I need separate intent log devices?</b><br />
 The SLOG feature is only useful if your workloads contain a fair amount of 
 synchronous writes. This happens in virtual machines and database software 
 a lot, but should not happen much at all when dealing with large file storage.
 <br /><br /><br />
 <b>What log devices should I use?</b><br />
 Log devices are only written to. 
 The only reads that will occur is when recovery is needed 
 after a power failure. So the separate log feature only does writes to the
 log device.
 It is important however that your SSD is protected by a supercapacitor, to
 protect against corruption and loss of data in case of a sudden loss of 
 power. Ordinary SSDs lose data in such an occurance. A suggested affordable 
 SSD suitable for the separate log feature, would be the Intel 320 series.
 <br /><br /><br />
 <b>Can I use more than one log device?</b><br />
 Yes, adding multiple log devices works very well.
 You can choose between RAID0 (striping) or RAID1 (mirroring) options.
 The striping means several log devices are interleaved simultaniously, 
 increasing performance linearly. It also spreads the write load on all 
 devices, meaning that each SSD only gets a part of the writes, increasing 
 the lifespan with each SSD you add. The mirror feature is available to cope
 with failed log devices, and ensures the log will keep functioning properly
 in case one of them fails. Do note that by mirroring the write workload also 
 increases, as each SSD will be written to with the same data.
 <br /><br /><br />
 <b>What size should my log device be?</b><br />
 Usually 2 or 4 gigabyte is more than enough for the log feature. The size 
 required depends on the speed of the pool, and the size of your transaction 
 groups. Keep your log partition rather small since a too large log partition
 is wasted space. If you use multiple SSDs in striping mode then should 
 look at the combined space instead.
 <br /><br /><br />
 <b>Does the log feature cost me a lot of precious write cycles?</b><br />
 SSDs currently use NAND chips which have a limited number of 
 program/erase-cycles. To clear up one misconception: ZFS does not write all
 data to the log device first, then transfer it to the main pool. Instead, 
 ZFS writes only synchronous data to the log device, which
 excludes the majority of most workloads. It is recommended that you
 monitor the rate of write cycles, by looking at the relevant SMART attributes.
 Also keep in mind that if you use multiple log devices in striping mode, 
 each log device receives only a portion of the writes, thus you spread the
 write load over all SSD devices.
 <br /><br /><br />
 <b>Should I perform overprovisioning on my SSDs?</b><br />
 Yes, when using an SSD as cache device it is highly recommended to leave a
 portion of space unused and never written to. This technique is called
 <i>overprovisioning</i> and it will enhance the lifespan of your SSD and
 helps to mitigate performance degradation. When using cache devices,
 using <b>20% to 40%</b> of overprovisioning is recommended.<br />
 Overprovisioning on a brand new SSD is easy: just create a partition smaller
 than the full capacity, leaving a major portion of space unused and
 unpartitioned. When using an SSD which is already used, you should perform a
 TRIM or Secure Erase procedure first, or the space reserved by overprovisioning
 won't work.
 <br /><br /><br />
 <b>Is there any risk associated to my pool?</b><br />
 Yes. By adding a separate log device, you essentially remove the logging from
 your main pool and use dedicated device for logging. This removes the 
 protection the intent log receives from your pool redundancy 
 (RAID-Z for example).
 If the SSD can not write safely, for example because it has no 
 (super)capacitors to protect against sudden power loss, it may not be able to 
 protect against loss of data. If the SSD becomes corrupt or otherwise damaged, 
 ZFS may need to revert to an earlier transaction group, meaning you lose a 
 couple of versions, like going back in time. The ZFS filesystem itself will 
 not be damaged however; the intent log is meant to protect your data from 
 misordered writes.
 Should your pool be of a lower version than 19, then removing the log device
 will not work and losing the log device means you lose access to the entire pool!
 <br /><br /><br />
 <b>Can I use the same SSD(s) for both caching and logging?</b><br />
 Yes. If you want both a separate log and cache, then using all SSDs for both
 tasks is actually recommended, because this spreads the writes over multiple
 devices and allows for some performance gains as well.
 <br /><br />
 <i>Example setup:</i><br />
 Assume you have 2 SSDs, each 64GB. A good setup would be reserving 2GiB
 partition for the separate log feature, and 40GiB for the cache. The rest of
 the capacity will be used for overprovisioning. Since you have two SSDs, you
 add two log devices: two partitions of 2GiB makes a 4GiB log device when
 striping (RAID0) them and 2GiB when mirroring (RAID1) them.
 <br />
 In addition, you use the two larger partitions to add two cache devices to your
 pool. Cache devices can only be striped, since redundancy here is irrelevant.
 Two partitions of 40GiB makes 80GiB total cache. This
 would consume between 1 and 2 gigabyte of RAM memory when fully utilized.
